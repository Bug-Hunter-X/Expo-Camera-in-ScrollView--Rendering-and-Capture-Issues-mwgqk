This error occurs when using Expo's `Camera` component within a `ScrollView`.  The `Camera` component doesn't inherently support being a child of a `ScrollView` due to how it manages its internal rendering and lifecycle.  Attempting to do so can lead to unexpected behavior, such as the camera not rendering correctly, failing to capture images, or causing the entire app to crash.
